## FakeFeatures is a Python GeoJSON generator
Use this tool to generate placeholder geospatial features, within an EPSG:4326 bounding box.
This tool generates points, polygons and linestrings and writes them out as a GeoJSON feature collection.
You can make changes to the config file to customise your feature collection.

### Usage:
Clone, update `config.json` and run from `main.py`. There should be no need to install any additional dependencies.
